# Portfolio01
My first Web Dev portfolio landing page. 

This is my week two Web Developement project.
The current link setup works best with the VS Code
Open Server. 
The code has a lot of notes inside explaining what does what. 
This website is currently not live. 
This has all the ideas I have in mind for a 
Web Dev Portfolio. I am hoping to build off of
this idea.

Let me know what your thoughts are on it,
let me know what you would do different
or let me know how this helped you!
Thanks! ~eric polley.
